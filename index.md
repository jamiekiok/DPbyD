# Mission 
This project is for our [Informatics 2020 Capstone course](https://ischool.uw.edu/capstone), in which we will create a Data Privacy by Design tool for software developers to use. With the formulation of data privacy regulations, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, *proactive* approaches to privacy are essential to ensure that the data of users is protected at all steps of the development process.

As shown above, we are folowing the _7 core principles of privacy by design_, as described by [Ann Cavoukian](https://iapp.org/resources/article/privacy-by-design-the-7-foundational-principles/ width="400" height="400"). 

## What is Data Privacy by Design?
Data Privacy by Design (DPbD) is a set of principles which promotes a proactive approach to system security. DPbD is part of the latest data protection legislation initiatives under the General Data Protection Regulation with which Avanade is responsible to comply. To better comply to the new regulation and protect personal information of Avanadeâ€™s stakeholders, we need a standardized toolkit which our developers can use to ensure that the security and privacy safeguards are met in new assets or applications in developmentdd`i.

## Partnership 
This project is sponsored by **Avanade**, who wants to take proactive action to protect user data privacy. Once the project term is over, the tool will be fully transferred to the hands of Avanade. 

## Key Features
We are currently in the design and development phase of our project. As our project moves to later pages, this landing page will be updated with visuals from our design.
