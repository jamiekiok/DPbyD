## Project Overview
This project is for our Informatics 2020 Capstone, in which we will create a Data Privacy by Design tool for software developers to use. 

## Motivation
This project is sponsored by Avanade, who wants to take proactive action to protect user data privacy. Once the project term is over, the tool will be fully transferred to the hands of Avanade.
